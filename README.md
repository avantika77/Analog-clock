# Analog Clock and Calculator
This repository contains two web applications: an analog clock and a calculator, both created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The analog clock features a real-time display with hour, minute, and second hands that update continuously to show the current time. The calculator provides basic arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, along with a clear button for resetting calculations. Both applications are designed to be simple, responsive, and user-friendly, demonstrating fundamental web development techniques.
